# esk8-Throttle-Control
An Arduino program to modify throttle inputs from an RC receiver to ESC on an electric skateboard

Right now this is a work in progress, none of the functions work other than the ability to relay the inputs 
from the throttle to a servo while applying a small amount of smoothing. The code is a mess and parts of it 
have been copy/pasted from other peoples work. I will add credits to the original authors of the code.
